HOW TO FIND POSTS ON DWF PAGE
=====
At the start and end of a string of posts there is a <table> element located between a <!--spacer--> and <!--/spacer--> pair of HTML comments. Each post is a <table> element contained between the pre-spacer and post-spacer. The spacer tables seem to have no defining attributes to distinguish them from posts themselves. Inside each post:

<table> // the post
  <tr>
    <td width="10"></td>
    <td width="100%">  // the stuff we actually care about (the post)
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <table>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>  // top of post (left and right sides)

                    <td> // left half
                      <a></a> // contains post id as element's id
                      <font>
                        <b>USER'S NAME HERE</b>
                      </font>
                      // more stuff we don't care about
                    </td>


                    <td> // right half
                      <font></font> // don't care about this; it's empty
                      <font></font> // THIS IS IMPORTANT; it contains the post's actual content; search here for <img>s and <a>s
                    </td>

                  </tr>

                  <tr>  // ditto for bottom (date / link on left, profile links on right)
                    <td> // left half
                      <font>
                        <img></img> // don't care about this; read/unread icon
                        EMPTY TEXT NODE CONTAINING THE DATE
                        <font></font> // contains the time
                        <a></a> // the link to the post!
                      </font>
                    </td>

                    <td> // right half
                    </td>
                  </tr>

                </tbody>
              </table>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td width="10"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
